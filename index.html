### Transcript:
Laura Laffrado: 
This is Laura Laffrado, Professor of English at Western Washington University. I’m going to give a brief introduction to Pacific Northwest author, Ella Higginson. 

At the turn of the twentieth century, Ella Higginson was the most famous author from the Pacific Northwest in the world. She had won multiple national awards, her books were extremely popular, her poems were sung by major dramatic singers of the day, her work appeared in periodicals and magazines and books in the United States and around the globe. Ella Higginson lived on Sehome Hill and the house that she and her husband had built there was one of the first houses on Sehome Hill. And this was before, what is now Western Washington University, had even been thought of. 

The house that they built on Sehome Hill meant that Higginson was able to ride her horse daily and take her dog with her all through the forests on Sehome Hill which had not been logged at that point. Ella Higginson never went to church, instead though she was a very religious woman, she said that she would go to Sehome Hill in the woods and walk around and there she would feel closest to God.

Laura Laffrado: This is Laura Laffrado. I’m a Professor at Western Washington University and I’m gonna talk about how Pacific Northwest author, Ella Higginson, was so able to admire and be familiar with and write about Sehome Hill. Ella Higginson’s house was built on Sehome Hill, where Viking Commons, part of Western Washington University now stands. 

Her house was three stories high. It was 400 feet above sea level and so her windows, her Bay windows, looked right out on Puget Sound. At the other side of her house, her windows looked right out on Sehome Hill. And for the longest time there weren’t any other buildings or houses there. And even when the building that is now known as Old Main is first constructed, it is the sole building on campus for quite a few years. So Ella Higginson pretty much, no matter where she was in her beautiful house, could look out over Puget Sound or could walk to the other end of her house and look out at Sehome hill.

The reason that Pacific Northwest author, Ella Higginson, is important when we think about the history of Sehome Hill, is because, not only did she live on Sehome Hill, but she is the only person who wrote about Sehome Hill in a very literary fashion in many of her poems and in many of her prose works. So when Ella Higginson writes about Sehome Hill, we can see the various stages that Sehome Hill goes through. 

She writes about the beauty of Sehome Hill before there are many homes on it. She writes about Sehome Hill before Western Washington University even exists. She writes about Sehome Hill when Settler Colonialists are setting the trees on fire on Sehome Hill at night, and burning all the trees down so that they could clear more land.

We know in the twenty-first century that these things happened on Sehome Hill. But it is only through Ella Higginson’s writing that we can actually see the history of Sehome Hill, stage by stage, and watch as it becomes a different part of a different community as time goes on.
